***SH- CAPSTONE PROJECT 1

**The project is titled "fylo landing page". 

It was a wonderful exprience for me personally as the team lead and the entire team member, because it was a eye opener to the amazing things we could do with just HTML and CSS in web development.

we were not off challenges when undergoing the project but the power of team work made it a lot easier to over them.

Though we had issues with getting to know ourselves as a team easier, we are glad we could still come up with something.

We used  CSS properties like flexbox , grid, inline-blocks and the likes to achieve the design of this amazing project.

Thanks to side-hustle for giving us this great opportunity of doing something worth doing.
